  challenge: "Obsidian users struggled with maintaining consistency across notes when referencing the same information multiple times. Updating project names, dates, or other repeated data required manual changes in every location, leading to inconsistencies and time-consuming maintenance tasks. Users needed a way to define data once and have it automatically sync across their entire knowledge base.",
  
  solution: "Developed Live Variables Plugin that introduces a dynamic variable system allowing users to define variables in frontmatter and reference them throughout their vault. The plugin features a smart query engine, code block execution, custom JavaScript functions, and a visual form interface. Variables update in real-time across all references, eliminating manual maintenance and ensuring consistency.",

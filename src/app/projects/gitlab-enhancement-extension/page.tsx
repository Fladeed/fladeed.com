  challenge: "A specific development team using GitLab faced repetitive manual tasks when analyzing commits, tracking related issues, and managing backports across releases. Their workflow involved frequent navigation between different systems and lacked contextual information, which slowed down their development process and increased the risk of missing critical dependencies.",
  
  solution: "Built a custom Chrome extension with background processing capabilities that seamlessly integrates with GitLab to address the team's specific pain points. The extension provides intelligent navigation, automated analysis tools, and real-time data fetching tailored to their workflow. Features include smart linking, backport analysis, and cross-release tracking with a clean, intuitive interface designed for their daily tasks.",

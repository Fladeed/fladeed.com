    challenge: 'The client needed a solution to improve software test effectiveness for their platform. Flaky tests were causing inconsistent results, reducing productivity, and making it difficult to make data-driven decisions. The platform lacked a centralized system to collect, visualize, and analyze regression test data, which hindered the team\'s ability to identify recurring issues and track test stability over time.',
    
    solution: 'We developed a Regression Metrics Dashboard to automate test data collection, visualize trends, and provide analytical insights. The solution included automated test data collection through Java and Gradle-based scripts integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, centralized storage in Oracle Autonomous Database, a comprehensive dashboard built with Oracle APEX for visual analytics, and seamless integration with existing build pipelines.',
